# Serverless Applications with TypeScript and NodeJS

This repo will guide you through creating serverless applications using TypeScript and NodeJS, utilizing various AWS services and frameworks such as:

## AWS Services

- **AWS Lambda**: Create functions in NodeJS and TypeScript to respond to various events, such as HTTP requests, topic messages, or other events, synchronously or asynchronously. Lambda functions are the basis for building serverless applications.

- **AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)**: A powerful framework created by AWS for modeling and provisioning resources in AWS. With it, you can create resources like Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables, or API Gateway using TypeScript, instead of using CloudFormation templates.

- **AWS API Gateway**: Build REST APIs and WebSocket APIs in a straightforward way, integrating perfectly with Lambda functions, and offering request body validation, API methods, and parameters.

- **AWS Lambda Layers**: Reuse and share code between functions using Lambda Layers.

- **AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS)**: A widely used resource for creating notification mechanisms for various applications or other services.

- **AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS)**: Allows the creation of queues for fast and reliable message delivery, enabling asynchronous communication between applications.

- **AWS DynamoDB**: A powerful NoSQL database service that allows the creation of tables, with automatic data deletion features, scalability, and much more.

- **AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)**: Allows the creation of buckets for secure file storage. It is also possible to configure events to be generated when these files are placed in these buckets, notifying other applications of these events.

- **AWS Simple Email Service (SES)**: Send emails from AWS Lambda functions easily.

- **AWS EventBridge**: This service allows the generation and routing of events in a more decoupled way, through the creation of rules based on highly configurable parameters.

- **AWS Identity Access and Management (IAM)**: Precisely control access to AWS resources by creating roles and policies that are assumed by AWS Lambda functions.

- **AWS X-Ray**: With this service, the instrumentation of Lambda functions is taken to a higher level, with the possibility of understanding the time spent on each part of its execution.

- **AWS CloudWatch Alarms**: Create alarms that aggregate logs generated by AWS Lambda functions, in addition to monitoring infrastructure parameters.

- **AWS Cost Explorer**: Obtain reports and graphs of resource consumption, divided by resource type and tags, which can identify applications and their parts.
